Basically in overlearning, the idea is that you continue to study something after you can recall it perfectly.
This is a classic way to help when one is taking comprehensive finals later in the semester.
The next factor that will influence memory relates to what we call organization.
There are lots of different types of organizational strategies and I¡¯ve listed those on slide four.
So let¡¯s begin by talking about the first organizational strategy called clustering and is located on page five.
In clustering, basically you recall items better if you can recognize that there are two or more types of things in a particular list.
Let¡¯s say that I give you the first list; north, cardinal, south, robin, east, wren, west, sparrow.
Now if you can recognize that north, south, east and west are points on a compass and cardinal, robin, wren and sparrow are birds, then you have a higher probability of recalling that material than if you just tried to recall the list in order.
The same occurs with the second list that is located on the right hand side of page six.
So let¡¯s list these words as well; pig, cat, horse, dog, sheep, birds, cow, and fish.
Now if you can recognize that these are two groups of animals; one being farm animals and the other being domestic companions, ala, pets, then you can recall that list of material better than if you just tried to recall the list in order.
In acrostics these are phrases in which the first letter of each word functions as a cue to help you recall some piece of information.
The most famous of these relates to this saying: On Old Olympus Towering Tops A Fin And German Vented Some Hops.
These relate to the twelve different cranial nerves that we have within the brain and if you are a traditional medical student or taking anatomy and physiology, this is the acrostic that you usually use to remember them.
A classic example of an acronym system is ROY G BIV which are the first letters of the colors in the visual spectrum.
Another verbal pneumonic technique is shown on slide 11 and called Rhymes.
So now we¡¯ve examined a variety of different verbal pneumonic techniques and how they work.
In this next section, we¡¯re going to examine some visual imagery types of methods to organize material.
Then when you¡¯re trying to recall the items during the exam, you begin your walk around the house.
So the first thing you think about is what happens when I walk in the back door and lo and behold, there¡¯s the first item I¡¯m trying to recall.
Then I open the door of the refrigerator and there¡¯s the third item and on and on until I have all the different materials that I¡¯m trying to remember put down for my exam.
Now the second type of visual imagery technique is shown on slide 14.
The classic example is One rhyming with Bun, Two and Shoe, Three and Tree, Four and Door and on and on.
Well what you might try to do is visualize a bee eating a great big bun.
So, let¡¯s say that you might have a frog with shoes on, and a horse knocking down a tree, or whatever it may be to the information that you¡¯re trying to recall.
So these are the first two techniques (overlearning, organization) that relate to factors that influence memory.
Well, the next major factor is shown on slides 16 and 17 and that is the order in which you learn things.
There¡¯s a couple different things you need to note about the serial position effect.
The recency effect occurs because you can generally only recall seven plus or minus two items in working or what is also called short term memory.
Now the serial position effect is shown in the graphical figure on slide 19.
Note within the middle of the list that you¡¯re trying to look at you only have about a 20% chance of recalling a particular set of items.
So the serial recall effect is extremely important for how you try to memorize things.
What this does is help you raise the level of the middle section within the recency of effect.
So, within the serial learning effect, what you should do is vary the order so you have good recall of information.
Now there¡¯s another variable that goes along with the serial position effect and is shown on slide 20.
So, we have the same kind of effect that we saw with the serial learning task we began with on earlier slides.
You can use it to your advantage by putting surprising or interesting things in the middle of the list of material that you¡¯re trying to memorize.
Here is where your past learning will interfere with your ability to recall new material.
What are important things for you about proactive and retroactive interference from an applied standpoint.
An example might be taking some sociology, some math, biology and computer science rather than taking sociology, psychology, anthropology, and maybe political science.
Now the next variable that¡¯s going to influence learning is what is called active participation.
In general, the more active you are during the learning cycle, the more you will recall, This is shown in slide 31.
Quizzing yourself while you¡¯re reading, determining how the material that you¡¯re currently working with relates to other material, using study guides, outlining the chapters or notes, etc., will significantly increase your recall of information.
The major one these relates to highlighting and chapter outlining or reading.
Now there¡¯s a related concept that goes with the similarity of learning and recall condition and this is shown in slide 35.
When I was in grad school many, many years ago, I drank a lot of Coca Cola, but I knew exactly how my body felt when I was taking the exam and when I was drinking the Coke while studying.
You walk out, you begin to relax, and guess what happens, you can recall the information again.
So, the best way to help yourself is to learn to stay relaxed while you¡¯re taking your exam.
As we show in slide 41, the reason you have problems is because of the serial position curve.
So in summary as we see here in the last few minutes is that there¡¯s a variety of different factors that influence memory.
